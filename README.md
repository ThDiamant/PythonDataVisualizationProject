# Python Data Visualization Project
Final project that was completed within the scope of the course "Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Representation in Python" offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

The goal was to find 2 (or more) datasets on the web that are related and use them to produce a visualization that answers a question of personal interest.

I picked the following question: 

*"How do the research volume (quantified in terms of number of journal articles published) and R&D expenditure compare between the USA and Germany for the period of 2000-2017?"*

The motivaiton behind that was an argument I had with a friend while I was doing my master's in Germany. He thought that the USA are more active than Germany research-wise and 
I was arguing the opposite. The question of which country is more active in scientific research is a multi-dimensional problem that is difficult to answer, but this little project 
explores one aspect of it.

The project involved:
  - Searching for the data to use.
  - Cleaning the data.
  - Transforming the data to answer the picked question.
  - Visualizing the result (using lower level matplotlib operations).

The final visualization is the following:
